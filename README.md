# Data-Analysis-on-CO2-Emission
Made using Google colaboratory.
This is a practice project where I was working on Data Analysis and Data Visualization of CO2 Emission of different countries all around the world. The data was extracted from "CO2_emission.csv" file. The analysis was done with the help of Pandas and visual &  graphical representation with Seaborn and Matplotlib.
